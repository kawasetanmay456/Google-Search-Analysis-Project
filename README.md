# 📊 Google Search Analysis Project
Unlocking insights from billions of daily searches using Python & Google Trends

Google processes 8.5 billion+ searches every day, generating massive real-time signals of public interest, behavior, and global events.
This project analyzes Google Search trends using Pytrends, transforming raw search activity into meaningful, actionable insights.

🚀 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a scalable, flexible analysis framework that extracts, visualizes, and interprets Google Trends data across multiple dimensions.

Using Python + Pytrends, the project answers key analytical questions such as:

Which countries search the most for a keyword?

How does interest change over time?

How do multiple keywords compare globally?

What patterns emerge from global and regional search behavior?

This project converts massive search data into clear visual stories.

🧩 Key Features
1. Dynamic Keyword Search

Easily plug in any keyword (or group of keywords).
The code automatically fetches search interest data from Google Trends.

2. Top 15 Countries Analysis

Generates ranked bar charts showing the top countries by search volume.

3. Global Heat Maps

Visualizes worldwide search distribution using color-intensity heatmaps.

4. Temporal Trend Analysis

Time-series line charts show how keyword interest changes across months/years.

5. Keyword Comparison

Compare multiple related terms to identify:

Search popularity

Trend overlaps

Seasonal variations
